### My SICP Solutions

This is my repo to practice using Github and upload all the solutions to the book 'Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - Second Edition'. I am doing this using the DrRacket programming environment, with their SICP dialect of scheme.

I am only uploading solutions that have a programming solution, any written/disucssion questions I am keeping elsewhere.
