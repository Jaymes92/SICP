;If you want to use the "let" assignment, you need to make rand a variable, not a procedure.
;If it was a procedure, the "let" would get called every time. Just start x = 0 for simplicity.
;I don't know how to make a reproducible random procedure, so my 'random' generator just increments by one for now for reproducibility.
